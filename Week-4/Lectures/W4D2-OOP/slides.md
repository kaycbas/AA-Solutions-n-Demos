## Complexity Limits Solutions

+ code complexity limit = short-term memory limit
+ You can hold **4 things** in short-term memory

If we reduce the mental complexity of code, we increase the complexity of the problems we can solve.


---

## OOP Controls Complexity

+ Locates related code in the same place
+ Limits inter-dependencies in code
+ Reduces repeated code (DRY)
+ Intuitive because it mirrors physical reality

---

## Questions?

1. OOP context
2. Software Complexity
3. OOP Advantages

---

## What is OOP?

+ Procedural:
    + functions operating on data
    + emphasis: step-by-step instructions
+ Object-Oriented:
    + functions and data are combined into objects
    + emphasis: interactions between objects

---

## How does OOP work?

+ Objects contain _data_.
+ Objects have _methods_.
+ Methods can access and modify an object's _state_ (any data that it contains).
+ Objects can interact with one another via their methods.


---

## Classes vs. Objects

+ A _class_ is the blueprint for an object.
+ An object is an _instance_ of a class.
+ In Ruby, objects are _instantiated_ using `::new`, which calls `#initialize`.

---

## UML

+ "Unified Modeling Language"
+ We'll use this to diagram classes today.

## The 4 Principles of OOP

1. Encapsulation
2. Abstraction
3. Polymorphism
4. Inheritance

---

## The 4 Principles of OOP

1. => **Encapsulation** <=
2. Abstraction
3. Polymorphism
4. Inheritance

---

### Encapsulation

+ All the data and logic for an object to work should be _encapsulated_ in that object.
+ No one else should have access to these things.
    + Indirect access available through the defined _interface_.
    + `public` & `private` keywords
    + `attr_reader`, `attr_writer`, `attr_accessor`

---

### What is an Interface?

+ A signature of _methods_, _arguments_, _argument types_, and _return types_.
+ Basically, anything that would cause a caller to break if changed.

---

### Coupling

+ The size and complexity of the interface between two objects.
+ _tight coupling_ = hard to change
    + Large interface or too much knowledge of implementation
+ Well-designed interfaces lead to _loose coupling_.

Let's try and refactor some procedural code using our Object-Oriented tools and the principle of _encapsulation_.

## Questions?

1. Encapsulation
2. Interface / Coupling (we'll flesh this out more later)
3. Demo

## The 4 Principles of OOP

1. Encapsulation
2. => **Abstraction** <=
3. Polymorphism
4. Inheritance

---

### Abstraction

#### Interface vs. Implementation

+ You only need to understand an object's _interface_ to use it.
+ No understanding of its _implementation_ is needed.
+ All of computation is built on this principle.

---

### Abstraction vs. Encapsulation

+ Complementary, but not the same.
+ Encapsulation: Each class should be self-contained.
    + If I modify a class's code, I shouldn't have to touch _any other_ code (unless I change the interface).
+ Abstraction: I shouldn't have to _think_ about how a class is implemented to use it.

### Duck Typing

+ "If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck."
+ Ruby is _dynamically typed_.
  + You don't have to declare variable types.
  + It doesn't complain about mismatched types.
  + You can get `NoMethodError`s.


---

### Polymorphism

+ Objects with the same interface are interchangeable.
+ _Even if_ they're different types.
+ You can use this to eliminate type-checking logic.


---

### Speaking of ducks...

### OOP (Object-Oriented Platonism)

![Platonic Class](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/appacademy/sf-lecture-notes/master/ruby/w4d2-oop/platonic_class.jpg?token=ABAUATTTDXW62MIOL2BLHJC5G2Z32)



---

## The 4 Principles of OOP

1. Encapsulation
2. Abstraction
3. Polymorphism
4. => **Inheritance** <=

---

### Inheritance

+ Keeps code DRY by letting you re-use class implementations
+ Overwrite or extend this implementation in the subclass
+ Very useful for _polymorphism_
    + Interchange different subclasses of a parent class.
+ Creates a hierarchy of classes back to `BasicObject`

---

`class SubClass < SuperClass`

### superclass
a.k.a. parent class, base class

A class that is used as the basis for inheritance.

### subclass
a.k.a. child class

A class that inherits from a parent class.


---

### `super`

+ methods on subclass override those of the parent
+ you can invoke the parent's overridden definition of a method using `super`.
  + `super` with arguments passes the given values into the super class' version
  of the method
  + `super` without arguments implicitly uses those passed into sub class'
  version of the method

---

### Let's try these out!

---

## Mixins

+ Mixins are an alternative to inheritance as a way of adding functionality to a class.
+ Mixins are modules. (e.g. `Enumerable`, `Comparable`, `Kernel`)
+ You can include multiple mixins in a single class.
+ You can define methods and use `self` and `@ivars`, just like when defining a class.

---

### `::include`

This command adds a module's methods to a class as _instance_ methods.

### `::extend`

This command adds a module's methods to a class as _class_ methods.

---

### Mixins vs. Inheritance

#### Types involved:

+ Inhertance uses **_classes_**.
+ Mixins are **_modules_**.

#### What you get:

+ Inheritance adds _both_ instance and class methods.
+ Mixins only add one or the other (`include` vs. `extend`).

---

### Mixins vs. Inheritance

#### How they're used:

+ Inheritance is used for objects that relate to each other taxonomically. (A `FordAnglia` is a `Car`.)
+ Mixins are used to add functionality to different kinds of things. (An enchanted `FordAnglia` and a `FlyingBroomstick` are both `Flyable`.)


---

### Meanwhile, back on the farm...

![Animal Farm](https://bookscarra.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/af30.jpg)

---

### Inheritance Pitfalls

+ Inheritance creates implicit dependencies.
    + Inherited methods and variables are not listed in the subclass code.
    + Multiple inheritance and mixins: potential for conflict.
+ Don't overwrite the interface!
    + Okay to change the implementation (but stay DRY)
    + Okay to add to the interface
---

## Important OOP Patterns for today

1. Null Object Pattern
2. Singleton Pattern

---

### Null Object Pattern

+ Standin for a null value that maintains a required interface
+ Avoids `NoMethodError`s
+ Ruby's `nil` itself is an example _#everythingisanobject_.
    + maintains the full `Object` interface
    + `to_s`, `is_a?`, `nil?`, etc.
    + doesn't include other methods you may need

---

### Singleton Pattern

+ Control access to a limited resource, usually some kind of IO.
    + (e.g. stdio, file system, screen, logger, etc)
+ Reuse reference to a stateless object (e.g. `nil`)

## OOP Tips

+ Decompose the system into parts
    + Nouns could be objects.
    + Verbs could be methods.
+ Single Responsibility Principle
    + A class does only one thing
    + Beware of the "God Object"
+ Define the interfaces first, then implement.
    + An object can have multiple interfaces.
    + Don't reach into an object. Stick to the interface.

---

### Questions?

1. Null Object Pattern
2. Singleton Pattern
3. Demo
4. OOP Tips
    + Object Decomposition
    + Single Responsibility Principle
    + Interface before implementation

---

## Exceptions

+ Tell the caller that you can't do what was asked.
+ Unhandled exceptions bubble up the call stack.
+ Sometimes raised on purpose to control program flow.
    + Whenever you want to exit a method without returning or continuing.
    + e.g. `404 Not Found` errors in Rails.

---

### Exception Syntax:

```rb
raise ErrorClass.new("message")

raise ErrorClass, "message"

raise "this shorthand will raise a RuntimeError"

begin
    do_something_dangerous
rescue
    change_parameters
    retry
ensure
    close_file
end

def implicit_begin
    do_something_dangerous
rescue TypeError => err
    puts "rescued from #{err}"
end

class MyCustomError < StandardError; end

raise MyCustomError, "I made my very own error!"
```

## The OOP Path

+ Creativity - more an art than a science
+ Experience - know where different design choices lead
+ Education - know common patterns and use them
    + Learn to pick the right tool for the problem at hand.
    + We're giving you some tools to start your toolbox.
    + I recommend _Head First Design Patterns_ after you're comfortable with the basics.
